This snippet of code is to check the usage of "Certified Secure" of students.
This project is to check progress of students, as well as giving a final grade. 

At our university, the first 6 challenges of CS gives a 'pass'. Any more fixed challenges will add up to the grade.

This is work in progress, and since I can't program, please behold ;)
